# PCA

Implemetend Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch on 's.wav' as input. Experimented with different samples sizes to check the performance of PCA with small and large amount of samples. Identified factors such as variance and sample size to prove why PCA performs better than Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
